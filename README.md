# Logger
A logger is a tool used in software development to record messages or information about the execution of a program. It’s often used for debugging, monitoring, or analyzing software behavior. Loggers are part of logging frameworks, which allow developers to track what’s happening in their applications.

在项目的 Cargo.toml 中添加依赖：
